    "text": "This is a part of the lyrics of a song called “Tashikana Koto” (Certain Thing) by Kazumasa Oda, and it’s my favorite part. There are many different translations, but to me, it means, “The most important thing doesn’t have to be special or perfect.” I love those old songs; they speak to you, to your soul. ✨ #LifeLesson\nPeople often forget or have never realized what is truly important in life. They strive to be, do, or create something perfect. They desire to have something perfect. But the very first thing you should understand is to appreciate what you have. Don’t complain, don’t be greedy.\nIn the song, the lyrics continue: “…not the special things, but to look at you always in the same way with the same love/feelings, which is most important.” 💖 Loving someone and being loved is what’s truly special, not the presents or the surprises. Sure, you can show your love with those things, but don’t take it for granted. Appreciate every single moment with your loved ones. 💕\n#SpreadLove by shimurk"
